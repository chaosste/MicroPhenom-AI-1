## About

MicroPhenom AI is a voice-enabled research tool for conducting micro-phenomenology interviews — the systematic exploration of the fine-grained structure of subjective experience. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, it guides interviewers and participants through the process of eliciting, recording, analyzing, and codifying first-person accounts of lived experience.

This is the **vanilla edition** — designed for exploring any lived experience, from everyday moments to extraordinary states. For psychedelic-specific phenomenology, see [Anubis](https://github.com/chaosste/Anubis).

## Key Features

- **US/UK Settings** — Spelling and accent preferences for voice output
